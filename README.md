# Plant-Disease-Prediction-using-ConvNets
This project is a Flask-based web application designed to identify plant diseases from leaf images using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The application provides users with the disease classification, detailed information about the identified disease, and best practices for plant care.

Features
Disease Detection: Identify whether a plant leaf shows signs of a specific disease or is healthy.
Confidence Levels: Get the confidence score for each prediction.
Disease Details: Access additional information about the disease, such as description, commonality, prevention tips, and plant growth requirements.
