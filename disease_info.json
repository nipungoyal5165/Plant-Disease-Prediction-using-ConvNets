    "Potato___Early_blight": {
        "description": "Early blight is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria solani, which mainly affects potato foliage but can also impact stems and tubers. It is marked by small, dark lesions on the older leaves that expand into round, target-like rings. As the disease progresses, the leaves may yellow and drop, reducing the plant's photosynthetic ability and ultimately leading to a decline in yield and tuber quality. This fungus tends to attack plants that are stressed by factors such as nutrient deficiencies, poor soil drainage, or extreme weather conditions.",
        "commonality": "Early blight is a widespread issue for potato crops, particularly in warm and humid climates or in areas with frequent rain. It is commonly found in potato-growing regions across the globe, affecting fields especially where crops have been planted in succession without adequate soil rest. The spores can survive in soil, plant debris, or volunteer potato plants, which allows the disease to persist from season to season if not properly managed.",
        "prevention": "Preventive measures include applying fungicides at the onset of the growing season, using certified disease-free seeds, and practicing crop rotation. Resistant potato varieties are also an effective option for high-risk areas. Additional practices like managing soil nutrition—maintaining adequate nitrogen while controlling phosphorus levels—and ensuring plants are not overcrowded can help minimize disease pressure. Avoiding overhead watering also helps reduce spore dispersal, while prompt removal of infected plants prevents further contamination.",
        "plant_info": "Potatoes are a globally important crop, known for their high carbohydrate content and culinary versatility. They grow best in well-drained, cool soil, with regular watering and balanced fertilizer applications. Potatoes are highly susceptible to various diseases and require attentive management to ensure high-quality yield.
